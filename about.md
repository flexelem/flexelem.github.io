Hi there,

I am Burak, a Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience. I have been mainly working on AWS ecosystem with both serverless architectures along with containerized microservices. I worked with Java, NodeJS and Python frameworks in production before.
I prefer to work with AWS as cloud provider along with AWS CDK as infrastructure as code.

I love designing and implementing software architectures based on any type of needs for companies.

Feel free to drop message to my inbox or don't hesitate connect me from Linkedin.
