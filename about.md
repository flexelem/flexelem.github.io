Hey All!

I am a passionate backend developer from San Francisco (well I am originally from Istanbul/Turkey) and I have been living here since Sep 2014. My main language is Java but nowadays trying to learn python as well! Python is fun :) Whatever, I am generally interested in distributed systems, scalability, and like to deal with huge amount client requests. Beyond that I am a humble, funny, bold and most important a truly team player.
