I am a Software Engineer/Cloud Architect with 10+ years of experience. I enjoy designing and building software architectures mainly focused on AWS. I love to take ownership of the product, research, ask questions and proactively raise concerns with stakeholders meanwhile mentoring people if needed and always value to be working as a team.

I have experience working in from early stage startups to large businesses with different domains including e-commerce, freight forwarding and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, adtech and more.

I am interested in both long term contractor and full time work mainly in SaaS applications with backend including NodeJS, Python, Java and technologies from AWS.

Feel free to shoot an email to my inbox or don't hesitate connect me from Linkedin.
